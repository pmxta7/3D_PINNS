# 3D_PINNS
This project uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to recover the underlying signal from noisy measurements of brain activity levels of human subjects. The work was developed under the supervision of Dr. Michelle Carey as part of an MSc in Data Science from University College Dublin, Ireland.
